NAME
    Catalyst::Engine::Apache - Catalyst Apache Engines

SYNOPSIS
    For example Apache configurations, see the documentation for the engine
    that corresponds to your Apache version.

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache::MP13" - mod_perl 1.3x

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP19" - mod_perl 1.99x

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP20" - mod_perl 2.x

DESCRIPTION
    These classes provide mod_perl support for Catalyst.

METHODS
  $c->engine->apache
    Returns an "Apache", "Apache::RequestRec" or "Apache2::RequestRec"
    object, depending on your mod_perl version. This method is also
    available as $c->apache.

  $c->engine->return
    If you need to return something other than OK from the mod_perl handler,
    you may set any other Apache constant in this method. You should only
    use this method if you know what you are doing or bad things may happen!
    For example, to return DECLINED in mod_perl 2:

        use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(DECLINED);
        $c->engine->return( Apache2::Const::DECLINED );

  NOTES ABOUT LOCATIONMATCH
    The Apache engine tries to figure out the correct base path if your app
    is running within a LocationMatch block. For example:

        <LocationMatch ^/match/(this|that)*>
            SetHandler          modperl
            PerlResponseHandler MyApp
        </LocationMatch>

    This will correctly set the base path to '/match/this/' or
    '/match/that/' depending on which path was used for the request.

    In some cases this may not be what you want, so you can disable this
    behavior by adding this to your configuration:

        PerlSetVar CatalystDisableLocationMatch 1

  NOTES ON NON-STANDARD PORTS
    If you wish to run your site on a non-standard port you will need to use
    the "Port" Apache config rather than "Listen". This will result in the
    correct port being added to urls created using "uri_for".

        Port 8080
